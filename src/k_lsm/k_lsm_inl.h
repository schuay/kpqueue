     *
     * ---
     *
     * A closer look at dist lsm's insert(): It looks like we can reuse the original
     * behavior up to the point when merges have been fully performed. Then, if the
     * block is large enough, 1) insert it into the shared lsm and 2) clear the dist
     * lsm.
     *
     * Items might be read twice (once from dist, once from shared), but that does
     * not matter since item removal is atomic.
     *
     * The biggest issue might be how to integrate memory management of dist lsm
     * and shared lsm blocks, since they use completely different mechanics: the dist
     * lsm has a pool relying simply on a 'used' flag, while the shared lsm has
     * a pool relying on the published version (of the global array) and a status
     * of each block. Shared blocks (blocks managed by the shared lsm) will never be
     * seen by the dist lsm, and do not need special consideration. Dist blocks on
     * the other hand will be seen by shared.
     *
     * We could either:
     * 1)  Copy the contents of the dist block to a shared block upon insertion.
     *     This adds amortized constant complexity since it's done exactly once
     *     for each item. It would keep the code simple since we don't need special
     *     cases for handling dist blocks in shared.
     * 1a) Instead of copying upon insertion, once we realize the next block will
     *     exceed our bounds, we could ask the shared lsm to allocate a block for our
     *     use instead.
     * 2)  Pass dist blocks into shared. We'd then have ensure they are properly
     *     marked unused once they are removed, and reserve enough space in the
     *     dist block pool to handle the additional blocks floating around.
     *     A problem again is that we cannot guarantee bounds on the number of used
     *     blocks if we set them unused after successfully updating the global array,
     *     since the current thread may stall.
     *
     * It seems best to start with option 1), optimizing to 1a) in the future.
